# Overview

There's a saying that goes, 'the job hunt is a job in itself.' Indeed, a significant amount of energy and time is often spent tailoring cover letters to match each job application. With the assistance of an AI, we can automate this process, drastically reducing the time it takes to prepare a cover letter to just a few seconds with a simple process of Scraping, Clicking, and Sending. Not only will your cover letter be fully customized, but it will also maintain a professional tone. Sounds promising, doesn't it? That's because it truly is.

# Technology Stack

1. OpenAI Assistant ChatGPT
2. Python
3. Selenium WebDriver

In this project, Selenium will facilitate various tasks such as navigating between pages, completing forms (e.g., login credentials), clicking links, and scrolling down. Apart from data scraping, Selenium will be instrumental in automating the outlined steps to manage actions until accessing the pages for data extraction. We will extract job offers and job descriptions.

Utilizing ChatGPT, known for its professional assistance, and leveraging your own resume as a knowledge base, ChatGPT will generate tailored resumes.

Python serves as the intermediary connecting the website, ChatGPT, and your personal information. Tkinter GUI is employed to provide a user-friendly interface.
